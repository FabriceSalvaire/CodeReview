  How-to: Use Graphviz to draw graphs in a Qt graphics scene

  Well, it's been a long time. This post will be dedicated to explanations on how
  to draw graphs in Qt's QGraphicsScene, using Graphviz. We're not talking about
  rendering an SVG graph with Graphviz and then printing it in a scene,
  however. What we will do, instead, is:

  represent a graph, using a C++ wrapper class for libgraph tell Graphviz to
  compute positions for each node, and the path of each edge draw our graph using
  QGraphicsEllipseItem and QGraphicsPathItem

  The whole thing is used in a computer security research project on which I'm not
  allowed to give any information, so I will be vague on some parts of this
  tutorial, and I will not provide a whole bunch of ready-to-run code. I'm still
  going to give you the hints for fulfilling the three tasks above, and I will
  publish the class I wrote for my project (it is, of course, not generic at all,
  since it was designed for my particular needs).

  This tutorial assumes you have a decent knowledge of how Graphviz works, and
  basic knowledge of the QGraphics API.

  Using libgraph to represent a Graphviz graph

  A little note on the libgraph API

  Before we begin, I would like to point out that the libgraph API is not always
  well designed. One thing that annoyed me is that all calls to the library
  require char * parameters when only const char * are needed, which results in
  compilation warnings. Since I don't like warnings, I wrote wrappers for the
  functions that I needed, so I wouldn't have to use qPrintable(), and I could
  hide the warnings with const_cast. For instance (the methods will be described
  in the next sections):
*/

/// The agopen method for opening a graph
static inline Agraph_t* _agopen(QString name, int kind)
{
  return agopen(const_cast<char *>(qPrintable(name)), kind);
}

/// Add an alternative value parameter to the method for getting an object's attribute
static inline QString _agget(void *object, QString attr, QString alt = QString())
{
  QString str = agget(object, const_cast<char *>(qPrintable(attr)));

  if(str==QString())
    return alt;
  else
    return str;
}

/// Directly use agsafeset which always works, contrarily to agset
static inline int _agset(void *object, QString attr, QString value)
{
  return agsafeset(object, const_cast<char *>(qPrintable(attr)),
		   const_cast<char *>(qPrintable(value)),
		   const_cast<char *>(qPrintable(value)));
}

/*
  Other functions defined this way: _agnodeattr(), _agedgeattr(), _agnode() and _gvLayout().

  Basic wrapper class

  The first step is to represent a graph so that Graphviz can compute
  it. Actually, Graphviz provides libraries for that, so you don't need to write a
  dot-syntax file and then use the very ugly (and completely unacceptable inside
  an application, in my opinion) system() call. A good introduction to this
  library is available as a PDF guide on Graphviz's website. I recommend reading
  it before going any further, because I may forget to explain things about
  libgraph!

  Unfortunately, there is no official C++ port of libgraph, and we're doing C++
  here, so we may want an object that will represent a Graph, with methods for
  adding Nodes and Edges. Here is a beginning of definition for such a class,
  which also contains bits of code for managing the aspect of our graph:
*/

/// An object containing a libgraph graph and its associated nodes and edges
class GVGraph
{
public:
  /// Default DPI value used by dot (which uses points instead of pixels for coordinates)
  static const qreal DotDefaultDPI;

  /*!
   * \brief Construct a Graphviz graph object
   * \param name The name of the graph, must be unique in the application
   * \param font The font to use for the graph
   * \param node_size The size in pixels of each node
   */
  GVGraph(QString name, QFont font = QFont(), qreal node_size = 50);
  ~GVGraph();

  /// Add and remove nodes
  void addNode(const QString& name);
  void addNodes(const QStringList& names);
  void removeNode(const QString& name);
  void clearNodes();

  /// Add and remove edges
  void addEdge(const QString& source, const QString& target);
  void removeEdge(const QString& source, const QString& target);

  /// Set the font to use in all the labels
  void setFont(QFont font);

private:
  GVC_t *_context;
  Agraph_t *_graph;
  QFont _font;
  QMap<QString, Agnode_t*> _nodes;
  QMap<QPair<QString, QString>, Agedge_t*> _edges;
};

/*
  And the associated methods, beginning with the static parameters and the
  constructor/destructor. All the attributes in the constructor are defined in
  Graphviz's documentation.
*/

/*! Dot uses a 72 DPI value for converting it's position coordinates from points to pixels
  while we display at 96 DPI on most operating systems. */
const qreal GVGraph::DotDefaultDPI = 72.0;

GVGraph::GVGraph(QString name, QFont font, qreal node_size) :

{
  if(_nodes.contains(name))
    _agset(_graph, "root", name);

/*

    {
      QPair<QString, QString> key(source, target);

/*
  Compute node positions and edge paths

  Surprisingly, this is the very easy part of the job. Graphviz already has
  several implementations of common graph drawing algorithms, used for different
  kinds of graphs. In Graphviz, they are called layout, and the most known one is
  dot. It also is the one I'm using, but you may write additional methods in your
  class for calling different kinds of layouts â€“ just be aware that some layouts
  require extra attributes, so you may also want to modify other parts of the
  class depending on what you need.
*/

void GVGraph::applyLayout()

/*
  At this point, you can even render your graph to a file, or to the standard
  output, using gvRender() and gvRenderFilename() (see the doc). You can also
  render your graph a first time, and then apply another layout on your rendered
  graph (some layouts can use position hints already provided in the graph, see
  the PDF guide.

  Once the layout has been called, many more attributes are set in the graph,
  nodes and edges's data field. Trying to access this information in the objects
  before would have lead to unitialised values and null pointers, so there are
  things that we can do only after having applied a layout. Among these things, we
  can now retrieve the exact size of the graph in points, and give this
  information to our QGraphicsView's setSceneRect() method, which defines the area
  of the QGraphicsScene that the user can see.
*/

		_graph->u.bb.UR.x*(dpi/DotDefaultDPI), _graph->u.bb.UR.y*(dpi/DotDefaultDPI));
}

/*
  Two notes about this function: it returns a lovely QRectF object, that we can
  manipulate much more easily than raw coordinates in Qt ; More important, it
  converts points into pixels, and it does so by applying a ratio equal to your
  actual DPI (96) divided by Graphviz's DPI (72). Of course, you may want to
  replace 96 by a class parameter or a constant. Just don't forget that libgraph
  excepts a coma and not a period as a separator for the integer and the floating
  part of reals.
*/

/*
  Transform the layout attributes into easy-to-use objects

  The next step consists of exploiting these attributes in order to draw our
  graph. As we don't want to manipulate structs and pointers, however, we will go
  through a translation step, and transform this raw data into sweet objects, so
  that all the complex code remains inside our class. Below are the said
  objects. As you can see, I did not bother with setters and getters, but these
  objects have a short lifespan, and they're only passed by copy to users of the
  GVGraph, so it didn't really matter to me what was done with them afterwards.

/*
  Two additional methods must now be added in order to provide these items to
  users. The simplest one is the node retrieval method, and most of it is
  straightforward. Just note that Graphviz calculates coordinates starting by the
  bottom-left corner, while QGraphics uses the top-left corner, so all
  y-coordinates must be translated.

/*
  The serious trouble begins just now: we need to transform a plethora of
  coordinates into a QPainterPath that can then be used in order to draw a
  line. Those of you who already messed with Qt's Bezier curves API know how it
  works: cubicTo() takes two arguments for the points that the curve must pass by,
  and one for the ending point, so you have to do multiple calls to it for drawing
  an entire spline. Very fortunately, it seems that the number of coordinates
  given by Graphviz always is 3n+1, which makes it possible to easily loop over
  the list of coordinates. The loop method I'm using is based on the one used for
  transforming Qt3 spline canvas objects into Qt4 Path objects.

  VoilÃ , we now have proper C++ items with all the relevant information in the way

  Draw the graph with Qt

  I am not going to provide code for this last part of the tutorial, as it would
  involve publishing code that belongs to the project I work on.

  All you have to know is that nodes are to be represented by QGraphicsEllipseItem
  objects (unless you specified another shape for Graphviz nodes, using the shape
  node attribute), and that these nodes must be positioned using the centerPos
  attribute of GVNode. This can be easily achieved by writing a setCenterPos()
  method that will translate the center coordinates into top-left coordinates and
  then call the setPos() method itself.

  As for edges, they typically are QGraphicsPathItem, and you only have to pass
  them the GVEdge's path when constructing them, or via the setPath() method. Easy
  as pie! And here we go for the comparison between Graphviz rendering and my own
  Qt-rendered objects (with support for all the QGraphicsItem events):
