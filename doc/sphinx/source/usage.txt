How to use CodeReview ?
-----------------------

CodeReview provides two applications *pyqgit* and *diff-viewer*.

This tool was written 10 years ago (late 2011) and I am using it for my own needs, thus it works as is.

I tried to implement a file watching feature but it is a nightmare to debug.

The Qt code is now a bit out dated, but the actual diff viewer implementation would require some
works to be ported to QML.
