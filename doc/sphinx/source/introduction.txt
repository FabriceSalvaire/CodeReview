 Introduction
==============

I code using the venerable `Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs>`_ editor and the extension
`Magit <https://magit.vc>`_ which is a powerfull text-based user interface to Git.  Despite, I am
happy with Magit for most tasks, I dislike the diff view rendering in Emacs.

Thus the goal of CodeReview is to provide a more convenient tool for code review tasks on local Git
repositories.  Unlike software like `Gerrit <https://www.gerritcodereview.com>`_, CodeReview is not
designed to do team-level code review, but to check the stage before a commit and show the
difference between two versions.  In particular, CodeReview fills the gap with IDEs that don't
provide a nice side-by-side diff view.

Historically, I wrote this tool as a replacement of **qbzr** for Git.
