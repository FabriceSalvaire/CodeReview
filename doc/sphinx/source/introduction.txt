 Introduction

The goal of CodeReview is to provide tools for code review tasks on local Git repositories.  Unlike
software like `Gerrit <https://www.gerritcodereview.com>`_, CodeReview is not designed to do
team-level code review, but to check the stage before a commit and show the difference between two
versions.  In particular, CodeReview fills the gap with IDEs that don't efficiently provide these
features.
